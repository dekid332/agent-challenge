# PEGG WATCH - Meme-powered AI Stablecoin Monitor

## Overview

PEGG WATCH is a comprehensive multi-agent AI system designed to monitor stablecoins, track whale movements, and preserve the history of failed stablecoins. Built for the Nosana Agent Challenge using the Mastra framework, it combines real-time monitoring capabilities with meme-powered storytelling and multi-platform distribution.

The system operates as both a full-stack web application and a Mastra-based agent system with specialized tools for stablecoin monitoring, whale tracking, and historical analysis through the Rug Museum.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live updates
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for agent communication
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Unified Etherscan V2 API for 50+ blockchain networks

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with Vite build system
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Shadcn UI components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for interactive transitions
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Theme**: Dark/light mode with custom cyberpunk aesthetics

### Nosana Agent Challenge Architecture
The application follows the Nosana Agent Challenge structure using the Mastra framework:

**Main Agent**: PEGG WATCH Agent with specialized tools
1. **Depeg Detector Tool**: Monitor stablecoin prices and detect peg deviations
2. **Whale Tracker Tool**: Track large wallet movements and transactions  
3. **Rug Museum Tool**: Explore historical failed stablecoin data

**Legacy Multi-Agent System** (for web dashboard):
1. **Depeg Detector Agent**: Monitors stablecoin prices every 30 seconds
2. **Digest Agent**: Generates daily performance reports
3. **Whale Trail Agent**: Tracks large wallet movements every 5 minutes
4. **Rug Museum Agent**: Maintains historical data of failed stablecoins

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **stablecoins**: Core stablecoin tracking data
- **alerts**: Real-time alert system with severity levels
- **whaleWallets**: Tracked whale wallet addresses
- **whaleTransactions**: Transaction history for whale movements
- **ruggedCoins**: Historical archive of failed stablecoins
- **digestEntries**: Daily digest reports

### API Services
- **CoinGecko Service**: Price data fetching without API keys
- **Etherscan Service**: Blockchain transaction monitoring
- **WebSocket Service**: Real-time client communication
- **Bot Service**: Multi-platform message distribution

### Bot Integrations
- **Discord Bot**: Slash commands and automated alerts
- **Telegram Bot**: Polling-based bot with command handling
- **Twitter Bot**: Tweet automation for critical alerts

## Data Flow

### Price Monitoring Flow
1. Depeg Detector Agent fetches prices from CoinGecko API every 30 seconds
2. Price deviations beyond 1% threshold trigger alerts
3. Alerts are stored in database and broadcast via WebSocket
4. Critical alerts (>5% deviation) are distributed to all bot channels

### Whale Tracking Flow
1. Whale Trail Agent monitors pre-configured wallet addresses
2. Etherscan API provides transaction data every 5 minutes
3. Large transactions (>1M tokens) generate whale alerts
4. Transaction data is stored for historical analysis

### Daily Digest Flow
1. Digest Agent compiles daily performance summaries at midnight UTC
2. Performance metrics are calculated from stored price data
3. Digest reports are formatted with meme commentary
4. Reports are distributed across all connected platforms

### Real-time Updates
1. WebSocket connections provide live updates to web clients
2. Agent activities trigger real-time notifications
3. Price changes update dashboard components immediately
4. Alert notifications appear as toast messages

## External Dependencies

### APIs
- **CoinGecko API**: Free tier stablecoin price data
- **Etherscan API**: Ethereum blockchain transaction data
- **Optional Solana RPC**: For Solana-based stablecoin tracking

### Bot Platforms
- **Discord Bot API**: Requires bot token and application ID
- **Telegram Bot API**: Requires bot token from BotFather
